# Python_Timer
Custom countdown timer with minimal UI and keyboard controll. When the time > 1 minute, the text is white. When time &lt;= 1 minute, the text becomes red and there is a sonor 'beep' notification.

The timer is sent to foreground, overlay over any app, including Powerpoint Presentations.


In the future I want to add remote control via Android Phone.
